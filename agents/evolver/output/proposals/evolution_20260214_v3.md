# Evolution Proposal 2026-02-14

## Executive Summary (For Telegram)
🚀 **GenieBot Evolution Update**: Today's tech scan reveals a major shift towards **Token-Efficient Code Navigation** (cgrep) and **Visual AI Workspaces** (OpenClaw Canvas). I propose upgrading our `reader_agent` with code-aware symbol extraction to reduce token waste by 90% and introducing a `CanvasAgent` for real-time visual system monitoring. We are also exploring the "AI Skills as Apps" paradigm to modularize Genie's capabilities.

## 1. Deep Dive: OpenClaw Exploration
OpenClaw is emerging as a powerful reference for self-hosted AI orchestration.
- **AI Skills vs. Agents**: OpenClaw treats capabilities as "Skills" (stateless, specific) rather than "Agents" (stateful, broad). We should adopt a `skills/` directory within agents to promote reuse.
- **Live Canvas (A2UI)**: A feature where the agent maintains a visual state (HTML/JS) that the user can see. This bridges the gap between CLI and UI.
- **Multi-Channel Hub**: The "WhatsApp Wrapper" trend on HN suggests a high demand for non-technical interfaces. Our Gateway should prioritize expansion beyond Telegram.

**Recommendation**: Update `GEMINI.md` to support a `skills/` pattern and create a `CanvasAgent` to host a local dashboard.

## 2. Optimization: Existing Agents

### A. reader_agent + Code-Aware Search (cgrep Logic)
The current `reader_agent` is excellent for web content but inefficient for local codebase analysis.
- **The Opportunity**: Implement the `cgrep` pattern (BM25 + Tree-sitter).
- **The Benefit**: Instead of reading whole files, the Orchestrator requests a "Symbol Map" (Locate) and then requests specific function bodies (Expand). This is documented to reduce token usage by **95%**.
- **Action**: Add `tree-sitter-python` to `reader_agent/venv` and implement a `--map` flag.

### B. stealth_browser + Playbook Library
To improve reliability, we should move away from raw JSON tasks to "Versioned Playbooks".
- **Action**: Create `agents/stealth_browser/playbooks/` containing verified logic for X-posting, weather-fetching, and login flows.

## 3. Proposed New Agents

| Agent Name | Purpose | Key Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CanvasAgent** | Maintains a visual "Dashboard" of system state, logs, and trading results. | HTML5 / Tailwind / local-web-server |
| **WhatsAppBridge** | Connects GenieBot to WhatsApp via a wrapper (OpenClaw style). | Flask / Twilio or WhatsApp Business API |
| **SkillStore** | A "Package Manager" for Genie to download new scripts/capabilities. | Git / Gist integration |

## 4. Architectural Trends: Memory & Efficiency
- **The "Locate/Expand" Protocol**: A new standard for IPC where the first call returns metadata/IDs, and the second call fetches the payload. This prevents "Context Overflow" during large file reads.
- **Story-First Personas**: Inspired by the "Steve Jobs Skill", we should refine `SOUL.md` to emphasize *why* we are building features (User Experience) over *how* (Implementation).

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Update `SOUL.md` to reflect the full agent list and "Story-First" philosophy.
2. **Phase 2 (Efficiency)**: Implement "Symbol Mapping" in `reader_agent`.
3. **Phase 3 (Vision)**: Prototype the `CanvasAgent` for visual feedback.
