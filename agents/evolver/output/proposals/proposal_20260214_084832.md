I will begin by reading the `history.md` file for the Evolver agent to ensure that my proposals do not duplicate previous work.
I will list the contents of the `proposals` directory and search for "OpenClaw" within the `agents` folder to determine the extent of its existing integration.
I will read the contents of `agents/evolver/output/proposals/evolution_20260214.md` to understand the details of the previous proposal and identify areas for further refinement or expansion.
I will read the `agents/evolver/output/proposals/proposal_20260214_075505.md` file to determine if its content differs from `evolution_20260214.md` and then proceed with refining the proposal based on my findings.
I will generate a new evolution proposal, `Evolution Proposal 2026-02-14 (v2)`, focusing on the newly discovered patterns: the Security Broker, Runtime Firewall, Team-based Orchestration, and MCP-Native Memory. I'll then update the `history.md` file to reflect these additions.
I will now update the `history.md` file to include the latest evolution proposal and its key components.
I have analyzed the latest tech trends and generated a new evolution proposal focused on deep security and team orchestration.

### Evolution Proposal 2026-02-14 (v2)

**Executive Summary (Telegram)**
🛡️ **GenieBot Security & Team Evolution**: A deep dive into today's tech trends (SEKSBot, Rampart, DevClaw) reveals critical upgrades for our core architecture:
1. **Secret Broker (SEKS Pattern)**: Moving API keys out of agent environments. Agents will use `SECRET_REF` tokens; the Gateway injects real keys only at the final request.
2. **Command Firewall (Rampart Pattern)**: Implementing a YAML-based policy engine to intercept and vet all shell commands before execution.
3. **Team-Group Orchestration (DevClaw Pattern)**: Enabling "Swarm Mode" in Telegram groups where Planner, Dev, and QA agents collaborate on a single task.
4. **MCP Memory Bridge**: Standardizing our `vector_store` to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for cross-tool interoperability.

The full report has been saved to `agents/evolver/output/proposals/evolution_20260214_v2.md`. History has been updated to reflect these new strategic directions.
