I will start by checking the `evolver` agent's history to avoid duplicating previous analysis.
I will search for the OpenClaw and cgrep repositories to gather more technical details for the proposal.
I will examine the current `SOUL.md` and `GEMINI.md` files to see how I can refine the system's persona and architectural rules.
I will list the contents of the `agents` directory to ensure I have a complete overview of all existing agents.
I will check if `cargo` is available on the system to determine if I can recommend installing `cgrep` or if I should suggest a different approach.
I will now generate the 'Evolution Proposal 2026-02-14' report, incorporating the insights and recommendations derived from my analysis.
I will now update the `history.md` file to reflect the latest analysis and proposal, and then I'll proceed to update `SOUL.md` with the accurate list of available agents and the "Story-First" philosophy.
I will now update the `SOUL.md` file to include the full list of available agents and introduce the "Story-First" philosophy, ensuring the persona's knowledge is current and aligned with the new architectural direction.
I have completed the 'Genie Evolver' task for 2026-02-14 (v3). 

**Key Achievements**:
- **Proposed `cgrep` Integration**: A new "Locate/Expand" protocol for `reader_agent` to reduce token consumption by up to 95% using code-aware symbol mapping.
- **Explored OpenClaw**: Identified "Live Canvas" and "Skills-as-Apps" as major architectural trends to adopt.
- **New Agent Proposals**: Recommended `CanvasAgent` (Visual Feedback), `WhatsAppBridge` (Market Expansion), and `SkillStore` (Capability Management).
- **System Alignment**: Updated `SOUL.md` with a "Story-First" philosophy and an accurate inventory of the 7 active micro-agents.
