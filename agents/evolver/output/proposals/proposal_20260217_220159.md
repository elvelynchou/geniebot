I will start by reading the `agents/evolver/memory/history.md` file to ensure I don't duplicate any previous proposals. Then, I will analyze the provided tech data, focusing on OpenClaw and other trends, to formulate the "Evolution Proposal 2026-02-17" with specific optimizations, new agent ideas, and architectural improvements.

I will create the 'Evolution Proposal 2026-02-17' by synthesizing the new tech data with our current system architecture. I'll focus on adding a 'think_agent' for structured reasoning, a 'DLP_proxy' for secret scrubbing, and an 'api_scout' for mapping undocumented APIs, while also proposing a local web dashboard for better monitoring.
