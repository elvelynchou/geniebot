# Product Definition

## 1. Vision & Core Value
**GenieBot (Bridge-03)** is designed as a **Self-Evolving Personal Super-Assistant**. It transcends traditional static automation by actively analyzing its environment, learning new skills, and optimizing its own architecture to maximize utility and profitability for its user.

**Target Audience:**
- Independent Developers & Tech-Savvy Individuals.
- Users seeking to automate personal workflows, R&D experiments, and profit-generating activities.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Autonomy:** Agents should coordinate via a Mesh Protocol with minimal human intervention.
- **Evolution:** The system must proactively suggest and implement architectural and strategic improvements.
- **Profitability:** Actions should be aligned with market opportunities and user-defined goals.

## 2. Key Features

### A. Comprehensive Self-Evolution
The system operates as a living organism ("GenieOS") capable of:
- **Architectural Correction:** Analyzing system logs and external trends (via `evolver`) to refactor its own code for stability and efficiency.
- **Skill Acquisition:** Automatically discovering, auditing, and installing new capabilities (Agent Skills) from repositories like GitHub.
- **Strategy Tuning:** Dynamically adjusting parameters (e.g., posting schedules, trading thresholds) based on performance feedback.
- **Agent Optimization:** Continuously refining the logic of individual micro-agents.

### B. Market Analysis & Profit Generation
A dedicated financial intelligence layer encompassing:
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Integration with crypto/stock APIs for price alerts and trend tracking.
- **Automated Trading:** Deploying specialized bots (via `stealth_browser` or API) to execute trades and on-chain interactions securely.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizing `reader_agent` to scrape news and social signals for data-driven decision making.

### C. Personal Operations Center
- **Task Management:** Integration with Google Calendar and `cronmaster` for scheduling.
- **Social Media Management:** Automated content generation (`imggen`) and publication (`socialpub`) across platforms.
- **Network Interaction:** Deep web search and interaction capabilities using stealth automation.

## 3. User Experience (UX)
**Hybrid Interaction Model:**
- **Telegram (Primary Interface):** For daily natural language commands, status checks, and notifications.
- **CLI (Power Interface):** For system setup, deep configuration, debugging, and complex architectural evolution tasks.

## 4. Success Metrics
- **Uptime & Stability:** Autonomous recovery from API errors (429s) and task failures.
- **Evolution Velocity:** Frequency of successful, user-approved system upgrades.
- **Action Success Rate:** Accuracy of social posts and trading execution.
